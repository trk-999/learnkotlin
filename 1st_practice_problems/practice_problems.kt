/*


This program prints a message that notifies the user that they received a chat message from a friend.


fun main() { 
    println("New chat message from a friend'}
}

1.) 	Can you figure out the root cause of the compile errors in this program and fix them?
2.) 	Does the code use appropriate symbols to indicate the open and close of the string and function argument?

Hint: You can use Kotlin Playground to run the code and view the compilation errors.

After you fix the errors, the program should compile without errors and print this output:

--------------------------------
New chat message from a friend
--------------------------------

fun main() {

}

/*
 1.) The string should end with a double quotation instead of a single quotation.
 2.) The function argument should end with a paretheses rather than a curly brace.
